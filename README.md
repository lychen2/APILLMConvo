# APILLMConvo

A modern, feature-rich web application for interacting with multiple Large Language Models through a unified, intuitive interface. Built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## 🌟 Purpose and Motivation

This project began as a personal utility to solve a practical problem: accessing modern AI models like Claude and Gemini can be difficult from certain regions, such as China. This tool provides a straightforward way to connect to these services using your own API keys through a unified proxy.

It's a personal project, built to scratch my own itch, and I'm sharing it in the hope that it might be useful to others facing similar challenges.

## 🤖 How It Was Built

It's important to mention that a significant portion of this application's code was generated with the help of **Claude**. My role was primarily to guide the development, refine the logic, and piece everything together into a functional tool. The credit for the heavy lifting goes to the AI itself.

## ✨ Key Features

### Core Functionality
*   **🔄 Unified Interface:** Chat with different LLMs without switching between multiple websites or applications
*   **⚙️ Provider Management:** Easily add, edit, and manage your API keys for various services through a user-friendly interface
*   **🔒 Local First:** Your conversation history and API keys are stored locally in your browser, not on any server
*   **🌍 Multi-language Support:** Interface available in 6 languages (English, 中文, Français, Deutsch, 日本語, Español)

## 🔧 Configuration

### Managing API Keys
1. **Individual Setup**: Click "Manage Providers" to add or edit API keys for specific models
2. **Bulk Setup**: Use "Set API Key for All" to quickly apply the same API key to all providers
3. **Provider Details**:
   - **Provider Name**: Predefined model identifiers (cannot be modified through UI)
   - **API Key**: Your authentication key for the service
   - **Description**: Optional description for easy identification

### Model Selection
- Models are predefined in the application (Gemini, GPT, Claude variants)
- Simply select from the dropdown to switch instantly between models
